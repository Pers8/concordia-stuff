#biol202/lec1  

## 1.1 What is Biology?  

- Biology is:: the scientific study of living organisms.  
- Biology literally means:: "study of life."  
- Examples of organisms studied in biology include:: humans, animals (e.g., bass), fungi (e.g., mushrooms), plants (e.g., lotus), protists (e.g., amoeba), and bacteria (e.g., *E. coli*).  

## 1.2 Biology = Study of Life  

- Biology is the study of:: life.  
- The central question of biology is:: What is life?  

## 1.3 What makes living organisms different from non-living materials?  

- A key question in biology is:: what distinguishes living matter from non-living matter.  
- Non-living examples include:: rocks, rings, or furniture.  
- Living examples include:: mouse, amoeba, lotus (plant).  

## 1.4 Common Features of Living Organisms  

- One of the defining features of living organisms is:: they are made of cells.  
- The cell is:: the smallest unit of life.  

## 1.5 Organisms are Made of Cells  

- Unicellular organism:: an individual made of only one cell (seen only with a microscope).  
  - Example:: bacteria (*Salmonella*)  
- Multicellular organism:: an individual made of multiple cells, usually large (some microscopic), for example humans.

- Examples of organisms made of cells include:: plants (leaf tissue), animals (human gall bladder tissue), protists (amoeba), and bacteria (*Salmonella*).  

## 1.6 Cells Reproduce by Cell Division  

- Cells reproduce by:: cell division.  
- In multicellular organisms, new body cells and body forms are created through:: repeated cell divisions.  
- Example of cell division in development:: a sea urchin egg divides → forms embryo → develops into an adult sea urchin.  

## 1.7 Organisms Use DNA as Genetic Blueprints  

- DNA is the:: genetic blueprint of life.  
- DNA is stored in:: the nucleus (in eukaryotic cells).  
- The role of DNA is to:: carry genetic instructions for reproduction, growth, and cell function.  

## 1.8 Organisms Use & Transform Energy  

- Living organisms require:: energy to survive and function.  
- Example of energy transformation in animals:: chemical energy (food) → physical energy (muscle movement).  
- Example of energy transformation in plants:: light energy → chemical energy (photosynthesis).  
- Photosynthesis converts:: light energy into chemical energy (stored as starch in tubers/leaves).  
- Metabolism is:: the set of chemical reactions in organisms that create or break down molecules.  

Examples of metabolic reactions:  
- Starch → sugar  
- Sugar → carbon dioxide  
- Carbon dioxide → sugar (via photosynthesis)  
- Sugar → starch  

## 1.9 Organic Molecules  

- Living organisms are mainly made of:: organic molecules.  
- Organic molecules are defined as:: molecules that contain carbon.  
- Main classes of organic molecules in biology are::  
  - Carbohydrates  
  - Proteins  
  - Lipids (oils, fats, etc.)  

## 1.10 Evolution  

- Evolution is defined as:: the process of species change over time.  
- All organisms alive today:: descended from earlier species.  
- Evidence of evolution:: fossil record (e.g., evolution of whales).  
- All species living today share:: a common ancestor.  
- Over time species:: diversified into bacteria, archaea, algae, plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates (including humans).  

## 1.11 Atoms – The Smallest Unit of Matter  

- An atom is:: the smallest unit of matter.  
- Everything (living or non-living):: is made of atoms.  
- Atoms cannot be:: broken down by chemical methods.  

Examples: gold, carbon, copper.  

## 1.12 Chemical Elements  

- Elements are:: different types of atoms.  
- Elements with different atomic numbers:: have different chemical properties.  
- Examples:  
  - Gold (atomic number 79)  
  - Carbon (atomic number 6)  
  - Copper (atomic number 29)  

## 1.13 Chemical Elements  

- Elements are:: different types of atoms.  
- Elements with different atomic numbers:: have different chemical properties.  
- Example elements: Gold (79), Carbon (6), Copper (29).  

## 1.14 Periodic Table Basics  

- Chemical elements are organized:: by atomic number.  
- Four major elements in living organisms are::  
  - H (hydrogen) → atomic number 1  
  - C (carbon) → atomic number 6  
  - N (nitrogen) → atomic number 7  
  - O (oxygen) → atomic number 8  

## 1.15 Other Important Elements in Biology  

- Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Phosphorus (P), and Chlorine (Cl) also play key roles in biology.  

## 1.16 Structure of an Atom  

- An atom is made of:: three subatomic particles.  
  - Proton → positive charge  
  - Neutron → no charge  
  - Electron → negative charge  
- Protons + neutrons are located in:: the nucleus.  
- Electrons orbit:: around the nucleus.  

## 1.17 Atomic Number and Hydrogen Example  

- The number of protons =:: atomic number.  
- Normally, the number of electrons =:: the number of protons.  
- Hydrogen atom has:: one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.

## Extra Context  

- **Exam anchor:** Professors often test “definition of biology” early — know it word-for-word (“scientific study of living organisms”).  
- **Scope of biology:** Encompasses all forms of life, from single-celled prokaryotes like *E. coli* to multicellular plants, fungi, and animals. Expect MCQs/lists where you must distinguish examples of life vs. non-life.  
- **Philosophical roots:** “What is life?” is an ancient question dating back to Greek philosophers. Modern biology approaches it scientifically, but this historical tie is sometimes referenced.  
- **Distinguishing life:** Later slides/textbook (Phelan 5e, Ch. 1) will define criteria like cellular organization, metabolism, homeostasis, growth, reproduction, response to stimuli, and evolution. For exams, **memorize the 7 characteristics of life** — this is a classic short-answer/MCQ question.  
- **Visuals:**  
  - Slide 23 images (bass, baby, amoeba, mushroom, *E. coli*, lotus) are standard examples of life.  
  - Slide 25 contrasts (mouse, amoeba, lotus vs. chair, ring) emphasize “life vs. non-life.” If diagrams are tested, make sure to be able to quickly identify life examples vs. non-life ones.  
</br>
- **Cell Theory (exam classic):** All living things are made of cells; the cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function; all cells come from pre-existing cells. Expect a multiple-choice or short-answer based directly on this.  
- **Unicellular vs. multicellular:**  
  - *Unicellular:* bacteria, archaea, many protists → one cell does everything (reproduction, metabolism, homeostasis).  
  - *Multicellular:* plants, fungi, animals → cells are specialized and interdependent.  
- **Exam tip:** Be able to **classify examples** as unicellular vs. multicellular (e.g., amoeba = unicellular protist, humans = multicellular animal).  
- **Visual importance:** The microscope images (plant leaf, gall bladder, amoeba, *Salmonella*) are representative — professors often show similar histology/photomicrographs and ask “Is this living?” or “Identify: unicellular/multicellular.”  
- **Phelan 5e reference:** Chapter 1 emphasizes that the **cell is the foundation of life**, and the distinction between unicellular and multicellular is one of the earliest classification points in biology.  
</br>
- **Cell division basics:**  
  - *Unicellular organisms:* cell division = reproduction (binary fission in bacteria, mitosis in protists).  
  - *Multicellular organisms:* cell division = growth, repair, and reproduction of gametes.  

- **Developmental biology angle:**  
  - In multicellular organisms, early embryonic divisions (cleavage) transform a single fertilized egg into a multicellular embryo.  
  - Morphogenesis (shape formation) is guided by successive cell divisions + differentiation.  

- **Exam tip:**  
  - Know the difference between *cell division in unicellular organisms* (as a method of reproducing the whole organism) and *cell division in multicellular organisms* (to grow, repair, or form new tissues).  
  - Diagrams like the sea urchin egg → embryo → adult are common in exams; be ready to explain “cell division drives both growth and reproduction.”  

- **Phelan 5e link:** Chapter 1 emphasizes that *all living things reproduce*, and at the cellular level, this means **cells give rise to new cells**. The sea urchin is a classic developmental example.  
</br>
- **Why DNA matters:**  
  - DNA stores hereditary information and ensures continuity of life across generations.  
  - During reproduction, DNA is copied and passed from parent → offspring.  
  - Errors in DNA (mutations) can create variation, which drives evolution.  

- **Molecular structure:**  
  - DNA is a double helix composed of nucleotides (sugar, phosphate, nitrogen base).  
  - Base pairing: A–T, C–G ensures faithful replication.  

- **Exam anchor:**  
  - “Where is DNA stored?” → in the nucleus for eukaryotes, cytoplasm (nucleoid region) for prokaryotes.  
  - “What does DNA do?” → blueprint for proteins, reproduction, and inheritance.  
  - They may show a DNA helix image and ask you to identify it or state its function.  

- **Phelan 5e tie-in:** Chapter 1 highlights DNA as the “instruction manual” for life — everything an organism does (metabolism, division, development) relies on DNA-guided protein synthesis. 
</br>
- **Definition:** Metabolism = sum of all chemical reactions in a cell/organism. Includes both **anabolism** (building up molecules, e.g., sugar → starch) and **catabolism** (breaking down molecules, e.g., starch → sugar, sugar → CO₂).  
- **Exam anchor:**  
  - Be prepared for definitions of metabolism.  
  - Expect questions like “Give one example of energy conversion in animals vs. plants.”  
- **Big picture:** Organisms are not passive; they constantly transform energy to maintain order (living systems fight entropy).  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 1):** Organisms require energy transformations to grow, reproduce, and maintain structures. Energy ultimately comes from the **sun** for most ecosystems.  
- **Visuals:**  
  - Flying bird (food → movement) emphasizes animal energy transformation.  
  - Potato plant (light → starch storage) emphasizes plant energy transformation.  
  - Professors often test with: *“In which form is energy stored in plants?”* (Answer: chemical energy in starch/sugars).  
</br>
- **Definition:** Organic molecules = carbon-based compounds, usually with hydrogen, often oxygen/nitrogen. Carbon’s ability to form 4 bonds makes it uniquely versatile for complex life chemistry.  
- **Key biological molecules:**  
  - **Carbohydrates** → energy (glucose), storage (starch, glycogen), structure (cellulose).  
  - **Proteins** → enzymes, structural proteins, signaling, transport.  
  - **Lipids** → membranes (phospholipids), long-term energy storage (fats/oils), signaling (steroids).  
- **Exam anchor:**  
  - You’ll almost certainly be asked to *name the 4 major classes of biomolecules* (the 4th — nucleic acids — is missing here but will come later).  
  - Know at least **one function/example for each**.  
- **Phelan 5e tie-in (Ch. 2):** Emphasizes that life’s chemistry is carbon-based, contrasting with inorganic molecules (like salts, water, metals).  
- **Professor pitfall to watch:** Don’t forget nucleic acids (DNA & RNA) — even though not listed on this slide, they are always included in the “big 4 biomolecules.” 
</br>
- **Definition:** Evolution = descent with modification. Over generations, populations change genetically, leading to new species.  
- **Core principle:** *Common descent* — all life on Earth shares a common ancestor.  
- **Whale evolution example:**  
  - *Pakicetus* (~50 million yrs ago) → land-dwelling mammal with traits linking it to whales.  
  - *Ambulocetus* (~49 mya) → amphibious, able to walk and swim.  
  - *Rodhocetus* (~47 mya) → more aquatic adaptations.  
  - *Basilosaurus* (~38 mya) → fully aquatic, early whale.  
  - Shows a **transition from land → water**, strong evidence for macroevolution.  
- **Phylogenetic tree slide:** Illustrates how all major groups (bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, animals) branched from a single ancestor.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Define evolution.” (process of change over time, descent from earlier species).  
  - “What is the evidence that whales evolved from land mammals?” (fossil sequence).  
  - “What do all living organisms share?” (a common ancestor).  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 1 & Ch. 10):** Evolution is the unifying theme of biology — explains both unity (common traits like DNA) and diversity (different adaptations).  
</br>
- **Definition:** An atom = nucleus (protons + neutrons) + electrons. The **atomic number** = number of protons, which determines the element.  
- **Why this matters in biology:**  
  - Life is built mainly from a small set of elements: C, H, O, N, P, S (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur).  
  - These “big 6” form proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “What is the smallest unit of matter?” → Atom.  
  - “Why can’t atoms be broken down chemically?” → Because chemical reactions rearrange atoms but do not destroy them.  
  - “What determines the identity of an element?” → The number of protons.  
- **Phelan 5e tie-in (Ch. 2):** The chemical building blocks of life start with atoms → elements → molecules.  
- **Visuals:** Gold, carbon, and copper illustrate how different atoms = different elements, each with unique properties. Expect a question like *“Carbon (6) vs. Copper (29): why are they different?”* (Answer: different atomic numbers = different properties).
</br>
- **Big 4 elements (C, H, O, N):** Make up ~96% of living matter.
    - **Carbon (C):** backbone of organic molecules.
    - **Hydrogen (H):** part of water and organic compounds.
    - **Oxygen (O):** major component of water and involved in respiration. 
    - **Nitrogen (N):** key for amino acids and nucleic acids. 
- **Other important elements (Na, K, P, Cl, Ca, S):**
    - Na⁺/K⁺ → nerve signaling. 
    - P → DNA, ATP, phospholipids.  
    - Cl⁻ → balance of fluids, stomach acid (HCl). 
- **Exam anchors:**
    - “Which 4 elements make up most of life?” (C, H, O, N). 
    - “Which subatomic particle determines the element?” (Protons).
    - “What is the atomic number of hydrogen?” (1).  
    - Expect a question like _“Which elements are most abundant in living organisms?”_  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):** The chemistry of life is based on a small set of elements, and knowing their atomic structure explains biological functions.
