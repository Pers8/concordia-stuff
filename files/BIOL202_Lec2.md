## 2.1 Structure of the Atom  

- Atoms are composed of:: three subatomic particles.  
  - Proton → positive charge  
  - Neutron → no charge  
  - Electron → negative charge  
- Protons and neutrons are located in:: the nucleus.  
- Electrons orbit:: around the nucleus.  
- The number of protons =:: atomic number.  
- Example (Carbon atom):: has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, 6 electrons.  

## 2.2 Four Major Elements in Living Organisms  

- The four major elements in living organisms are:: Hydrogen (H), Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O).  
- Number of protons =:: atomic number.  
- Number of electrons =:: number of protons (in a neutral atom).  
- Atomic mass =:: number of protons + number of neutrons.  
- The number of neutrons can:: vary between atoms of the same element (→ isotopes).  

| Element | Atomic | Protons | Neutrons | Electrons | Atomic Mass |
| :------ | :----: | :-----: | :------: | :-------: | :---------: |
| H       |   1    |    1    |    0     |     1     |      1      |
| C       |   6    |    6    |    6     |     6     |     12      |
| N       |   7    |    7    |    7     |     7     |     14      |
| O       |   8    |    8    |    8     |     8     |     16      |
## 2.3 Isotopes  

- Isotopes are:: atoms of the same element that carry different numbers of neutrons.  
- Isotopes have:: the same number of protons but different atomic masses.  
- Example – Carbon Isotopes:  
  - Carbon-12 → 6 protons, 6 neutrons  (99% abundance)  
  - Carbon-13 → 6 protons, 7 neutrons  (~1%)  
  - Carbon-14 → 6 protons, 8 neutrons  (trace radioactive isotope)  
- Carbon-14 is:: used in radiocarbon dating.

## 2.4 Electron Shells  

- Electrons orbit:: the nucleus in specific energy levels called shells.  
- The innermost shell holds:: 2 electrons.  
- The outer (shell) can hold up to:: 8 electrons.  
- When the outer shell is filled:: the atom is stable (chemically inert).  
- When a shell is not full:: the atom becomes reactive and forms bonds to fill it.  
- Example atoms: He (2 e⁻), Ne (10 e⁻), Ar (18 e⁻).  

## 2.5 Hydrogen  

- Hydrogen has:: one electron occupying the first electron shell.  
- The first shell can hold:: a maximum of 2 electrons.  
- Because hydrogen has only one electron:: it tends to form one bond to fill its shell (e.g., H₂, H₂O).  

## 2.6 Carbon  

- Carbon has:: 6 electrons.  
- Distribution of electrons:  
  - 2 in the first shell  
  - 4 in the second shell  
- Carbon has:: 4 valence electrons.  
- It forms:: four covalent bonds to achieve stability (octet rule).

## 2.7 Molecules  

- Molecules are:: formed by combinations of atoms.  
- Atoms are joined together by:: chemical bonds.  
- Example:: H₂O (water molecule).  
- The chemical formula shows:: the types and numbers of atoms in a molecule.  

## 2.8 Outer Electron Shell and Bond Formation  

- The outermost electron shell (valence shell):: determines if an atom will form bonds.  
- If the outer shell is full:: the atom is stable and does **not** form chemical bonds.  
- If the outer shell is not full:: the atom is unstable and will form bonds to fill it.  
- Example:  
  - Hydrogen (H) → outer shell not full → forms bonds.  
  - Helium (He) → full outer shell → does not form bonds.  

## 2.9 Inert Gases  

- Inert gases are:: atoms with completely filled electron shells.  
- Inert gases do not:: form chemical bonds.  
- Examples: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar).  

## 2.10 Types of Chemical Bonds  

- There are three main types of chemical bonds:  
  - **Covalent bonds** → strong  
  - **Ionic bonds** → weaker  
  - **Hydrogen bonds** → weakest 

## 2.11 Covalent Bonds  

- A covalent bond is:: a chemical bond formed when two or more atoms share outer (valence) electrons.  
- Covalent bonds form:: stable molecules by completing the valence shells of atoms.  
- Example: Two hydrogen atoms share their electrons → form a covalent bond → H₂ molecule.  
- The structural formula of hydrogen gas is:: H–H.  
- Covalent bonds are:: strong and common in biological molecules.  

## 2.12 Types of Covalent Bonds  

- There are two main types of covalent bonds::  
  - **Non-polar covalent bonds**  
  - **Polar covalent bonds**  

## 2.13 Non-Polar Covalent Bonds  

- Occur when:: atoms share electrons equally.  
- Bonds between identical atoms are:: non-polar covalent bonds (e.g., H₂, O₂).  
- Bonds between hydrogen and carbon are:: also non-polar covalent bonds (e.g., CH₄).  
- Molecules made entirely of non-polar covalent bonds are:: non-polar molecules.  
- Examples:: H₂, O₂, CH₄.  

## 2.14 Polar Covalent Bonds  

- Occur when:: atoms share electrons unequally.  
- One atom pulls electrons more strongly (higher **electronegativity**) than the other.  
- This creates:: slight charges within the molecule.  
- Example – **Water (H₂O):**  
  - Oxygen attracts electrons more strongly than hydrogen.  
  - Oxygen side becomes slightly **negative (δ⁻)**.  
  - Hydrogen side becomes slightly **positive (δ⁺)**.  
  - This polarity allows water to form **hydrogen bonds**.  

## 2.15 Non-Polar vs. Polar  
?

| **Non-Polar**                 | **Polar**                          |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Atoms share electrons equally | Atoms share electrons unequally    |
| No charge separation          | Partial positive and negative ends |
| Examples: H₂, O₂, CH₄         | Examples: H₂O, NH₃                 |
| Common in hydrocarbons        | Common in molecules with O or N    |

## 2.16 Identifying Polar Molecules  

- Among N₂, C₄H₁₀ (butane), and C₂H₆O (ethanol):: **ethanol** is the polar molecule.  
- Why?  
  - Ethanol contains:: an oxygen atom that attracts electrons more strongly than hydrogen (O–H bond).  
  - This creates:: a partial negative charge (δ⁻) on oxygen and a partial positive charge (δ⁺) on hydrogen.  
  - N₂ and C₄H₁₀ are non-polar because::  
    - N₂ → same atoms share electrons equally.  
    - C₄H₁₀ → C–H bonds are non-polar, overall molecule has no charge separation.  

## 2.17 Ionic Bonds – Formation of NaCl  

- Ionic bond occurs when:: **one atom donates** an electron and **another gains** it.  
- Example:: **Sodium (Na)** and **Chlorine (Cl)** form table salt (NaCl).  
- Sodium (Na)::  
  - Atomic number = 11 → 11 electrons.  
  - Has **1 electron** in its outer shell (unstable).  
- Chlorine (Cl)::  
  - Atomic number = 17 → 17 electrons.  
  - Has **7 electrons** in its outer shell (needs 1 more to be stable).  
- Formation::  
  - Sodium transfers its outer electron to chlorine.  
  - Sodium becomes **Na⁺** (positive ion).  
  - Chlorine becomes **Cl⁻** (negative ion).  
- Attraction between Na⁺ and Cl⁻ forms:: an **ionic bond**.  

## 2.18 Hydrogen Bonds  

- A **hydrogen bond** is formed when:: a slightly positive hydrogen atom in one polar molecule is attracted to a slightly negative atom (O, N, or F) in another molecule.  
- This attraction:: is **weaker** than both covalent and ionic bonds.  
- Hydrogen bonds occur:: **between** molecules — not within a single molecule.  
- Example:: between water molecules (H₂O) — the positive H of one molecule attracts the negative O of another.  
- Hydrogen bonds can be **broken by heat**, which is why water vaporizes when boiled.  

## 2.19 Properties of Water Important to Life  

- Water’s unique properties are due to:: its **polar covalent bonds** and **hydrogen bonding** between molecules.  
- The four main life-supporting properties of water are:  
  1. **Cohesion and surface tension**  
  2. **Large heat capacity**  
  3. **Low density as a solid**  
  4. **Good solvent**

## 2.20 Cohesion  

- Cohesion means:: the **sticking together** of water molecules due to hydrogen bonding.  
- Hydrogen bonds make:: water molecules “stick together.”  
- Because of cohesion:: water can travel upward against gravity in plants (e.g., the giant sequoia).  


## 2.21 High Surface Tension  

- Surface tension is:: the force that makes the surface of water act like a stretched film.  
- Cause:: **Hydrogen bonds** between water molecules create a net-like structure at the surface.  
- Effect:: This gives water its “tight” surface — allowing small objects or insects to rest or move on it without sinking.  
- Example:: Water striders and spiders can walk on water due to strong surface tension.  
## 2.22 High Heat Capacity  

- Water has a **high heat capacity**, meaning:: it can absorb or release large amounts of heat with only a small change in temperature.  
- Cause:: **Hydrogen bonds** absorb heat energy when they break and release heat when they reform.  
- Result:: Heat from the sun is used to **rearrange hydrogen bonds** instead of directly increasing the water’s temperature.  
- Biological impact:: Living organisms in water live in **stable thermal environments**, protected from sudden temperature changes.  

## 2.23 Low Density as a Solid (Ice Floats)  

- Solid water (ice) is **less dense** than liquid water because:: hydrogen bonds form a **crystalline lattice** that keeps water molecules farther apart.  
- As a result:: ice **floats** on liquid water.  
- This property is **unique** to water and vital for life on Earth.  

## 2.24 Water as a Good Solvent  

- **Solvent** is:: a liquid that can dissolve another substance.  
- **Solute** is:: the substance that is dissolved in the solvent.  
- **Solution** is:: a mixture of solute and solvent.  
- Water dissolves many substances because:: it is **polar** — its molecules have partial positive (H) and negative (O) ends that surround and separate ions or polar molecules.  
- Example: NaCl (table salt):: water molecules surround Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions — the partially negative oxygen faces Na⁺ and the partially positive hydrogen faces Cl⁻.  

## 2.25 Hydrophilic vs Hydrophobic Substances  

- **Hydrophilic (water-loving):** molecules that *dissolve easily* in water because they are **charged or polar**.  
  - Examples: ions (Na⁺, Cl⁻), sugars like glucose.  
- **Hydrophobic (water-fearing):** molecules that *do not dissolve* in water because they are **non-polar**.  
  - Example: oil, lipids.  
- **Reason:** water molecules form strong hydrogen-bond networks that exclude non-polar molecules.

## Extra Context  

- **Definition recap:**  
  - *Atomic number* identifies the element and equals the number of protons.  
  - *Atomic mass* (or mass number) = protons + neutrons.  
  - *Isotopes* are variants of the same element that differ in neutron number (e.g., C-12 vs C-14).  
- **Why it matters in biology:**  
  - Atomic composition determines how atoms bond and form molecules essential for life (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids).  
  - Carbon’s 4 valence electrons make it the backbone of organic chemistry.  
  - Oxygen and hydrogen are key for water; nitrogen for amino acids and nucleotides.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Which subatomic particle defines the element?” → proton.  
  - “How is atomic mass calculated?” → protons + neutrons.  
  - “What are isotopes?” → same element, different neutrons.  
  - Be ready to identify basic atom models or complete a missing value in a table (like # protons or atomic mass).  
- **Phelan 5e tie-in (Ch. 2):** Focuses on how understanding atomic structure is the foundation for bonding and molecular behavior in cells.
</br>
- **Stable vs unstable isotopes:**  
  - Stable isotopes (C-12, C-13) remain unchanged over time.  
  - Unstable radioisotopes (C-14) decay and release radiation at a predictable rate, used to date organic materials (~50,000 years limit). 
- **Importance in biology:**  
  - Isotopes can trace biological pathways (e.g., radioactive phosphorus for DNA research).  
  - Energy levels explain chemical bonding — how atoms gain, lose, or share electrons.  
  - The “octet rule” (8 electrons in outer shell) explains stability of noble gases and reactivity of others (e.g., Na + Cl). 
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Define isotope and give an example.”  
  - “Why is carbon-14 radioactive while carbon-12 is not?”  
  - “How many electrons in the first/second shell?”  
  - “What makes an atom chemically stable?” (full outer shell). 
- **Phelan 5e tie-in (Ch. 2):** Describes atomic structure and energy levels as the basis for chemical bond formation and molecular behavior.  
</br>
- **Hydrogen:**  
  - Simplest element — one proton, one electron, no neutrons.  
  - Commonly forms covalent bonds (H–H, O–H) rather than ionic because it shares electrons.  
  - Found in almost every biological molecule (water, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids).  
- **Carbon:**  
  - Backbone of all organic molecules due to its four valence electrons.  
  - Can bond with many elements (H, O, N, S, P) and form single, double, or triple bonds.  
  - Its ability to form chains and rings allows for molecular diversity in living organisms.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “How many valence electrons does carbon have?” → 4.  
  - “Why does carbon form four bonds?” → to complete its outer shell (8 electrons).  
  - “Why is hydrogen highly reactive?” → it seeks to fill its first shell with 2 electrons.  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):** Carbon’s bonding capacity underlies molecular structure and complexity in biology, while hydrogen participates in nearly all biochemical compounds. 
</br>
- **Chemical stability:**  
  - Atoms are most stable when their valence shells are full (2 for the first shell, 8 for others).  
  - This drives atoms to bond — gaining, losing, or sharing electrons to achieve stability.  
  - Known as the **octet rule**.  
- **Types of bonds (preview):**  
  - **Ionic:** transfer of electrons (NaCl).  
  - **Covalent:** sharing of electrons (H₂O, CO₂).  
  - **Hydrogen bonds:** weak attraction between polar molecules (H₂O molecules).  
- **Inert gases (noble gases):**  
  - Have naturally full valence shells → chemically nonreactive.  
  - Found in Group 18 of the periodic table.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “What determines whether an atom forms chemical bonds?” → its valence shell.  
  - “Why don’t noble gases react?” → they have full outer shells.  
  - “What is a molecule?” → two or more atoms chemically bonded.  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):** The concept of chemical bonding connects atomic structure to molecule formation and the stability of biological compounds. 
</br>
- **Covalent bonds:**  
  - Form when atoms share one or more pairs of electrons.  
  - Very stable and common in biological molecules (e.g., H₂O, CO₂, CH₄).  
  - Can be *single, double, or triple bonds* depending on electron pairs shared.  
- **Ionic bonds:**  
  - Form when one atom transfers electrons to another, creating charged ions.  
  - Example: Na⁺ and Cl⁻ form NaCl (table salt).  
  - Strong in solid form, weaker in water (dissociate into ions).  
- **Hydrogen bonds:**  
  - Weak attractions between a hydrogen atom (already covalently bonded to O or N) and another electronegative atom.  
  - Example: between water molecules → gives water high cohesion, surface tension, and heat capacity.  
- **Bond strength comparison:**  
  Covalent > Ionic > Hydrogen  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Rank the three bond types from strongest to weakest.”  
  - “What type of bond holds atoms together in water?” (Covalent)  
  - “What type of bond is responsible for attraction between water molecules?” (Hydrogen)  
  - “Why are ionic bonds weaker in biological systems?” (Because water breaks them apart easily).  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):** Explains how the balance of bond strength and flexibility allows biological molecules to maintain structure while still reacting dynamically in cells.
</br>
- **Mechanism:**  
  - Each hydrogen atom has one electron and needs one more to fill its shell (2 electrons total).  
  - When two H atoms share their electrons, both achieve a filled first shell → stable molecule.  
  - The shared electrons are attracted to both nuclei equally.  
- **Types of covalent bonds:**  
  - **Single bond:** one shared electron pair (H₂, Cl₂).  
  - **Double bond:** two shared pairs (O₂, CO₂).  
  - **Triple bond:** three shared pairs (N₂).  
- **Biological importance:**  
  - Found in DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.  
  - Provides molecular stability in cells while allowing reactivity in biochemical reactions.  
- **Comparison note:**  
  - Covalent bonds are stronger than ionic and hydrogen bonds, especially in aqueous (water-based) environments.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “What defines a covalent bond?” → sharing of electrons.  
  - “Why does hydrogen form H₂?” → to fill its first electron shell (2 electrons).  
  - “Draw or label a hydrogen molecule showing shared electrons.”  
  - “Which bond type is strongest in living organisms?” → Covalent.  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):** Covalent bonding is highlighted as the foundation of organic chemistry — carbon, especially, uses covalent bonds to form the backbone of biological molecules.  
</br>
- **Electronegativity:**  
  - The ability of an atom to attract electrons.  
  - Oxygen and nitrogen are highly electronegative → often create polar bonds.  
- **Why polarity matters in biology:**  
  - Determines solubility — *polar molecules* dissolve in water, *non-polar molecules* (like fats) do not.  
  - Enables the formation of hydrogen bonds → critical for DNA base pairing and protein folding.  
  - Creates molecular interactions (e.g., hydrophilic vs hydrophobic behavior).  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “What is the difference between polar and non-polar covalent bonds?”  
  - “Why is water a polar molecule?”  
  - “Which bonds are present in methane?” (Non-polar).  
  - “How does polarity influence solubility?” 
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):**  
  Discusses how the polarity of molecules underlies water’s unique properties — cohesion, surface tension, and its role as a solvent for life.  
</br>
- **Ethanol’s polarity:**  
  - The hydroxyl group (–OH) makes ethanol polar → can form hydrogen bonds with water. 
  - This is why ethanol mixes with water (both polar).  
- **N₂ and Butane:**  
  - Nitrogen gas (N₂) → identical atoms = perfectly equal electron sharing.  
  - Butane (C₄H₁₀) → composed of only carbon and hydrogen, both low electronegativity difference → non-polar molecule.  
- **Key takeaway:**  
  - Polarity depends on both bond type *and* molecular shape.  
  - A molecule can have polar bonds but still be non-polar overall if the charge distribution is symmetrical (e.g., CO₂).  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Which molecule is polar and why?”  
  - “Why can ethanol dissolve in water but not butane?”  
  - “What role does the O–H bond play in polarity?”  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):** Highlights ethanol as a common biological example of polarity — its ability to dissolve in water contrasts sharply with non-polar lipids, explaining why cell membranes are hydrophobic.
</br>
- **Nature of Ionic Bonds:**  
  - They form due to **electrostatic attraction** between oppositely charged ions.  
  - They are **weaker in water** because water molecules separate the ions (dissociation).  
- **Ionic compounds properties:**  
  - Usually **crystalline solids** (like salt).  
  - **High melting and boiling points** due to strong ionic lattice.  
  - **Conduct electricity** when dissolved in water (**electrolytes**).  
- **Electron transfer visual:**  
  - Na → loses electron → outer shell becomes stable (full).  
  - Cl → gains electron → outer shell now complete with 8 electrons.  
  - Result: both achieve **noble gas configuration**.  
- **Analogy:**  
  - Think of Na giving its “extra” electron gift to Cl — both become happy and stable. 
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Explain how NaCl forms an ionic bond.”  
  - “What happens to Na and Cl atoms during ionic bonding?”  
  - “Why do ionic compounds conduct electricity when dissolved?”  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):**  
  - Highlights ionic bonds as fundamental to biological ions (Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻) that maintain **nerve transmission** and **osmotic balance** in cells. 
</br>
- **Key idea:**  
  - Hydrogen bonds are **intermolecular** forces (between molecules), unlike covalent and ionic bonds which are **intramolecular** (within molecules).  
  - They form only when hydrogen is covalently bonded to **highly electronegative atoms** — fluorine (F), oxygen (O), or nitrogen (N).  
- **Examples:**  
  - Between **water molecules** → gives water its high surface tension and boiling point.  
  - Between **ethanol and water** → explains why they mix (both can hydrogen bond).  
  - Between **hydrogen fluoride (HF)** molecules → very strong due to high electronegativity of fluorine.  
- **Strength comparison:**  
  - Covalent bond → **strongest**  
  - Ionic bond → **weaker**  
  - Hydrogen bond → **weakest**  
- **Physical importance:**  
  - Responsible for the **liquid state of water** at room temperature.  
  - Stabilizes **DNA double helix** (between base pairs).  
  - Helps proteins maintain their **3D structure** (hydrogen bonding between amino acids).  
- **Thermal behavior:**  
  - Hydrogen bonds require energy to break — this is why **ice melts slowly** and **water resists rapid temperature changes**.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Explain what causes hydrogen bonds and how they differ from covalent bonds.”  
  - “Why does water have a higher boiling point than methane?”  
  - “List one biological importance of hydrogen bonding.”  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):**  
  - Hydrogen bonds are highlighted as **crucial for water’s life-supporting properties**, influencing temperature regulation, cohesion, adhesion, and biomolecular stability. 
</br>
- **1. Cohesion & Surface Tension**  
  - Cohesion: water molecules stick together through hydrogen bonding.  
  - Surface tension: created by cohesive forces at the surface → allows insects to “walk” on water.  
  - Biological example: water moves upward in plant vessels through *capillary action*.  
- **2. Large Heat Capacity**  
  - Hydrogen bonds absorb heat before breaking → water resists temperature changes.  
  - Stabilizes body temperature and climate.  
  - Example: coastal regions have milder climates because water absorbs and releases heat slowly.  
- **3. Low Density as a Solid**  
  - When water freezes, hydrogen bonds lock molecules in a lattice → increases space between them.  
  - Ice is less dense than liquid water → floats and insulates aquatic life below.  
- **4. Good Solvent**  
  - “Universal solvent” — polar water molecules surround ions and polar molecules, dissolving them easily.  
  - Non-polar molecules (like oils) do **not** dissolve in water.  
  - Enables chemical reactions in cells (metabolism occurs in aqueous environments).  
- **Key takeaway:**  
  - Life depends on water’s hydrogen bonding — it underlies stability, structure, and biochemical reactions.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Explain how hydrogen bonding gives water its unique properties.”  
  - “Why is ice less dense than liquid water?”  
  - “What property of water allows temperature regulation in organisms?”  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):**  
  - Water’s properties are central to life’s chemistry — every biological process (digestion, DNA stability, temperature regulation) is tied to hydrogen bonding and polarity.  
</br>
- **Mechanism:**  
  - Each water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules.  
  - This creates a continuous chain of attraction between molecules.  
  - When one molecule moves (e.g., through evaporation at the leaf), it pulls others up behind it.  
- **Biological example:**  
  - In trees, cohesion allows water to move from **roots → stems → leaves** without breaking the water column.  
  - This process is essential for **nutrient transport** and **photosynthesis**.  
- **Cohesion vs Adhesion:**  
  - Cohesion = water–water attraction.  
  - Adhesion = water–surface attraction (helps in capillary action).  
- **Key takeaway:**  
  - Cohesion enables continuous water flow in plants, maintaining hydration and transport even in tall trees.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “What role does cohesion play in water transport in plants?”  
  - “How do hydrogen bonds create cohesive behavior in water?”  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):**  
  - Hydrogen bonding explains why water droplets form and why tall trees can move water hundreds of feet — a direct biological effect of molecular polarity. 
</br>
- **Molecular mechanism:**  
  - Each surface molecule of water forms **hydrogen bonds** with molecules beside and below it.  
  - Fewer neighbors above cause stronger bonding forces horizontally → forms a “skin-like” surface layer.  
- **Real-world examples:**  
  - **Water strider** standing on water: its legs distribute weight evenly, not breaking hydrogen bonds.  
  - **Diving example:** when you belly-flop, the surface tension resists penetration briefly before breaking — this is why it hurts!  
- **Biological relevance:**  
  - Surface tension helps form **water droplets** on leaves and **capillary movement** in small tubes.  
  - Plays a role in **alveoli (lungs)** — surfactants lower surface tension to allow breathing.  
- **Key takeaway:**  
  - Surface tension results directly from **hydrogen bonding**, a property unique and vital to water’s biological functions.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Explain how hydrogen bonds create surface tension.”  
  - “Give one biological example of surface tension in action.”  
  - “Why can some insects walk on water?”  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):**  
  - The book uses water’s surface tension as a classic example of hydrogen bonding — linking molecular interactions to real-life phenomena like insects walking on water and droplet formation. 
</br>
- **Molecular explanation:**  
  - In liquid water → hydrogen bonds **constantly break and reform**, allowing molecules to pack closely.  
  - In solid ice → each water molecule forms **stable hydrogen bonds** with four neighbors, creating an **open hexagonal structure** → more space between molecules → **lower density**.  
- **Biological importance:**  
  - When lakes freeze, **ice forms on the surface**, creating an **insulating layer** that prevents the entire body of water from freezing.  
  - This allows **fish and aquatic life** to survive under the ice during winter.  
  - The floating ice also helps **regulate climate**, reflecting sunlight and preventing heat loss from oceans and lakes.  
- **Real-world examples:**  
  - Icebergs float in the ocean because of this property.  
  - Seasonal freezing and melting cycles influence **nutrient circulation** in aquatic ecosystems.  
- **Key takeaway:**  
  - Hydrogen bonding makes water **expand upon freezing**, reducing its density.  
  - Without this property, **aquatic life would not survive** harsh winters, and Earth’s ecosystems would be very different.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Explain why ice floats on water.”  
  - “Describe how hydrogen bonds affect the density of ice.”  
  - “How does ice’s low density support life in cold climates?”  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):**  
  - Notes that water’s solid form being less dense than its liquid form is critical for **life persistence in frozen environments** and **energy balance on Earth**.  
</br>
- **Why water dissolves substances well:**  
  - Its **polarity** allows it to surround ions and polar molecules, separating them and keeping them evenly distributed (hydration shells).  
  - Water’s structure makes it a **“universal solvent”** in biological systems.  
- **Biological importance:**  
  - Most biochemical reactions occur in aqueous solutions.  
  - Nutrients, salts, and gases are transported dissolved in water (e.g., in blood plasma or cytoplasm).  
  - Non-polar molecules (like fats and oils) form **membranes** and **barriers** because they don’t mix with water — this separation is essential for **cell structure**.  
- **Hydrophilic vs hydrophobic contrast:**  
  - Polar molecules → form hydrogen bonds with water → dissolve.  
  - Non-polar molecules → disrupt hydrogen bonds → excluded from solution (phase separation).  
  - Explains why **oil and water don’t mix**.  
- **Key takeaway:**  
  - Water’s polarity defines its solvent power and explains **cell membrane formation**, **nutrient transport**, and **biochemical reactions**.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Why is water called the universal solvent?”  
  - “Explain the difference between hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances.”  
  - “Describe how water dissolves salt (NaCl) at the molecular level.”  
- **Phelan 5e reference (Ch. 2):**  
  - Discusses water’s role as a **polar solvent** critical to life — enabling transport, digestion, and molecular interactions within living organisms.
