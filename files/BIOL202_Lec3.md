## 3.1 Ionization of Water  

- Water molecules occasionally ==**dissociate (ionize)**== into ions.  
- The process forms::  
  - **Hydrogen ions (H⁺)** → a proton formed when water loses an electron.  
  - **Hydroxide ions (OH⁻)** → formed when water gains an electron.  
- In pure water:: the concentration of H⁺ equals that of OH⁻.  
- The relative amounts of H⁺ and OH⁻:: change depending on substances dissolved in water. Example: Adding acid increases H⁺ concentration, while adding base decreases it.

- **pH 7** → neutral (pure water).  
- **High pH (8–14)** → basic (low H⁺ concentration, high OH⁻ concentration).  
- Relationship between H⁺ and pH:: as H⁺ concentration ↑ → pH ↓ (inverse logarithmic relationship).  
- Each pH unit represents:: a **10-fold change** in H⁺ concentration (logarithmic scale).

  - *Cellular respiration:* process that converts chemical energy from glucose into ATP.  
  - *Monosaccharide:* simplest sugar unit absorbed by the body.  
  - *Complex carbohydrate:* polysaccharide that breaks down slowly into simple sugars.  
- **Biological relevance:**  
  - Glucose fuels every cell, especially the **brain and muscles**.  
  - Enzymes like **amylase and sucrase** catalyze the breakdown of complex carbs in digestion.  
  - Balanced diets favor **complex carbohydrates** for sustained energy and metabolic stability.  
- **Real-life examples:**  
  - Simple sugars: soda, candy, pastries.  
  - Complex carbs: oatmeal, brown rice, whole grains, vegetables.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Why is glucose called the body’s main fuel?” → it’s used in cellular respiration to produce ATP.  
  - “Why are complex carbohydrates healthier than simple sugars?” → slower digestion, steady blood sugar.  
  - “What happens when you eat high-sugar foods?” → rapid spike then crash in energy.  
- **Phelan 5e tie-in (Ch. 3):**  
  - Explains how carbohydrate digestion and metabolism connect energy storage to energy use.  
  - Highlights why **complex carbs** are essential for sustained biological energy release.

- **Definition recap:**  
  - *Glycogen:* polymer of glucose stored in animals for energy.  
  - *Fat:* long-term energy storage molecule composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen atoms.  
- **Biological relevance:**  
  - When blood glucose drops, **glycogen** is broken down (via glycogenolysis) to supply glucose.  
  - If glycogen reserves are depleted, **fats** are mobilized (via lipolysis) for energy.  
  - This system ensures a **steady supply of fuel** even during fasting or exercise.  
- **Examples:**  
  - After a meal → glucose levels rise → stored as glycogen.  
  - Between meals or during exercise → glycogen is broken down to maintain blood glucose.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Where is glycogen stored in the body?” → liver and muscles.  
  - “What is the difference between glycogen and fat storage?” → glycogen = short-term; fat = long-term.  
  - “What happens to glucose that is not immediately used?” → converted into glycogen or fat.  
- **Phelan 5e tie-in (Ch. 3):**  
  - Explains how **carbohydrate metabolism** links to energy balance and homeostasis.  
  - Emphasizes the role of **glycogen** as the body’s quick-access energy source.

- **Definition recap:**  
  - *Cellulose:* a polysaccharide composed of glucose units linked differently than in starch, making it indigestible for humans.  
  - *Glycogen:* animal energy reserve; *cellulose:* plant structural material.  
- **Biological relevance:**  
  - Glucose metabolism ensures energy balance through **ATP production**, **glycogen storage**, and **fat synthesis**.  
  - Cellulose, though indigestible, is **crucial for digestion** and used by herbivores (e.g., cows, termites) via symbiotic bacteria.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Digestible carbs → rice, pasta, potatoes.  
  - Indigestible carbs → whole grains, beans, vegetables (high in cellulose).  

- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “List the three fates of glucose.” → energy use, glycogen storage, fat conversion.  
  - “Why can’t humans digest cellulose?” → lack of enzymes to break β-glycosidic bonds.  
  - “What role do dietary fibers play?” → improve digestion and regulate blood sugar.  
- **Phelan 5e tie-in (Ch. 3):**  
  - Discusses how **glucose homeostasis** supports metabolism and how **cellulose** remains a key example of structural carbohydrates in plants and non-digestible fibers in human diets.  
</br>
- **Chemical difference:**  
  - Starch → α(1→4) glycosidic linkages.  
  - Cellulose → β(1→4) glycosidic linkages (require cellulase enzyme).  
- **Prebiotics vs. Probiotics:**  
  - *Prebiotics* = food for beneficial bacteria.  
  - *Probiotics* = the beneficial bacteria themselves.  
- **Health implication:**  
  - Diets high in fiber promote bowel regularity and lower cholesterol.  
- **Exam anchors:**  
  - “Why can’t humans digest cellulose?” → no enzyme for β-linkages.  
  - “How does cellulose contribute to plant structure?” → rigidity & resistance to pressure.  
  - “What are prebiotics?” → non-digestible fibers that nourish gut microbes.  
- **Phelan 5e tie-in (Ch. 3):** emphasizes how structural polysaccharides like cellulose and chitin contribute to biological strength and stability in organisms.
