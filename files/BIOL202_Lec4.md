A few issues arise :
- The Add vault tool pick is clicked ot the folder container
- The design I asked for the scrollbar is not implemented with the animation of thj escrollbar appearing and that it should be rounded on the edges and mucih tthinner. I think you didn't change the actual electron scrollbar so you need to actual need to adjust that so it works
- The vault folders are clipped in the container so when I hover it gets cut out a little
- The scrollbar should be a little bit more on the right

Also when I click the 3 dot button and click it on the vault folder at the bottom, it get clipped to the whole app window which isn't good so please make sure that it doesn't get clipped and it goes through the electron app if thzt makrs sensre. Send me the whole code with the chzanges
