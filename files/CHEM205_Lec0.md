## 1.1 The Scientific Method  

- Qualitative data refers to:: descriptive information (non-numerical, e.g., color change, texture).  
- Quantitative data refers to:: numerical measurements (e.g., mass, temperature, volume).  

- A tentative explanation for an observation is called a:: hypothesis.  
- Systematic, controlled observations and measurements are part of:: experiments.  

- A law is a:: verbal or mathematical description of *what happens* in nature.  
- A theory (model) is a:: proposed explanation of *why behavior occurs*.  

- In the scientific method, the correct order of steps is? 
?
  - Observation  
  - Hypothesis  
  - Experiment  
  - Law (describes what happens)  
  - Theory (explains why it happens)  
  - Experiment (modify as needed)  

- Key difference between law and theory:
?
  - A **law** summarizes and predicts behavior but does **not explain why**.  
  - A **theory** provides the explanation behind the observed behavior.  
## Reporting results to other scientists  
- Experimental results should be:: reproducible.  

- Why must results be reported in sufficient detail?:: So that they can be used or reproduced by others.  

- Student lab results are typically reported in:: notebooks & reports.  

- Research results are typically reported in:: the scientific literature.  

- Scientific conclusions should be:: reasonable and unbiased.  

- In reporting scientific work, credit should:: be given where it is due.  

## Units of measurement & numerical information  

- Qualitative observations are:: descriptive (e.g., color, texture, odor).  

- Quantitative observations are:: numerical (e.g., mass, volume, temperature).  

- A measurement is:: a quantitative observation consisting of **two parts**: a number + a unit.  

- Why must a measurement always have a unit?:: Because a number without a unit is meaningless.  

- Examples of valid measurements include?  
?

  - 93 students  

## SI (metric) system of units  

- The SI system is:: a decimal-based system of units.  

- The common SI base units are:: gram (g), meter (m), liter (L), and second (s).  

- SI prefixes are used to:: denote values larger or smaller than base units.  

- Mega (M) means:: 1,000,000 = 10^6.  
- Kilo (k) means:: 1,000 = 10^3.  
- Deci (d) means:: 0.1 = 10^-1.

- Nano (n) means:: 0.000000001 = 10^-9.  
- Pico (p) means:: 0.000000000001 = 10^-12.  

- Which SI prefixes are most commonly used in chemistry?  
  - Mega (M), kilo (k), deci (d), centi (c), milli (m), micro (μ), nano (n), pico (p)  
?


## Quantitative observations: intrinsic vs extrinsic properties  

- Quantitative observations =:: measuring things (numerical values).  

- Properties with numerical values do not necessarily:: reflect the sample’s size.  

- Intrinsic (intensive) properties are:: characteristics of the substance itself, **not the amount present**.  
  Examples: density, melting point, boiling point, viscosity.  

- Extrinsic (extensive) properties are:: properties that **depend on the quantity** of substance present.  
  Examples: mass, volume, length, width, height.  

- Is temperature an intrinsic or extrinsic property?:: Intrinsic (it does not depend on the amount of substance).  

## Scientific temperature scales  

- The relationship between Celsius and Kelvin is::  
  T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15  

- Are Celsius and Kelvin increments the same size?:: Yes, but they are offset by 273.15.  

- Absolute zero = 0 K =:: -273.15 °C.  

- Liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K =:: -196 °C.  

- Room temperature is 25 °C =:: 298 K.  

- Why do scientists prefer the Kelvin scale?:: Because it is an **absolute scale** with no negative values, making equations simpler.  
- At normal pressures, solid CO₂ (dry ice) sublimates above -78.51 °C.  
What is this temperature in Kelvins?:: 194.64 K. 

## Measurements: Uncertainty & Significant Figures  

- Digits unambiguously read off a scale are:: certain (known exactly).  

- The last digit in a reported measurement is:: always estimated (uncertain), but **significant**.  

- Why is the last digit significant even if it is uncertain?:: Because it reflects the precision of the measuring instrument.  

- In an analog scale, the last digit is determined by:: estimating between gradations.  

- In a digital scale, the last digit is:: estimated by the machine.  

- 0.6 m ± 0.1 means the precision is:: to the tenths place (1 decimal).  
- 0.65 m ± 0.01 means the precision is:: to the hundredths place (2 decimals).  
- 0.648 m ± 0.001 means the precision is:: to the thousandths place (3 decimals).  
- Size of stick =:: 10⁻³ m (1 mm).  
- Increments =:: 10⁻⁵ m (0.01 × 10⁻³ m).  
- Precision level =:: increment + 1 digit.  

- A measurement made with this stick =:: 0.328 mm = 0.328 × 10⁻³ m (± 0.001 × 10⁻³ m). 


## Sources of error  

- Random error (indeterminate error) means:: measurement has an equal probability of being high or low.  
- Are random errors avoidable?:: No, they are usually unavoidable.  

- The magnitude of random error is determined by:: the size of the scale’s divisions.  
- The direction of random error is determined by:: chance — it varies each time the last digit is estimated.  

- Systematic error (determinate error) means:: error occurs in the **same direction** each time (always too high or always too low).  
- Systematic error often results from:: poor technique or poor experimental design.  

- The magnitude of systematic error is determined by:: the size of the scale’s divisions and the worker’s attention to detail.  
- The direction of systematic error is determined by:: the calibration of the instrument.


## Comparing data sets: precision vs accuracy 
![[Pasted image 20250928094127.png|600]]

- Precision refers to:: how close repeated measurements are to each other.  

- Accuracy refers to:: how close a measurement is to the accepted (true) value.  

- A balance that gives consistent values but not necessarily the true value is:: precise but not accurate.  

- A balance that gives values close to the accepted value is:: accurate (may or may not be precise).  

- Accepted value of a penny’s mass since 2000 is:: 2.35 g.  

- Top-loading balance (avg 2.34 ± 0.01 g) is:: more accurate.  

- Digital analytical balance (avg 2.3201 ± 0.0009 g) is:: more precise.  

- Which balance was improperly calibrated, causing systematic error?:: The digital analytical balance (shifted away from the accepted value).   

- % relative error =:: (Observed – Accepted) ÷ Accepted × 100.  

- If the numerator is taken as an absolute value, it tells you:: whether the value is too high or too low. 

## Significant Figures (SF)  

- Significant figures reveal:: the precision of a measuring method.  

- Reporting more digits than the instrument’s precision allows is:: misleading (false precision).  

- You weigh 25.7172 g of NaCl crystals on a balance with ±1 mg precision.  
How many significant figures should be reported?:: 5 SF → 25.717 g.  

### Rules for counting significant figures  

- Non-zero integers:: always count as significant figures. Example: 345 m has 3 SF.  

- Captive zeros (zeros between non-zeros):: always count as significant figures. Example: 16.07 mL has 4 SF.  

- Leading zeros:: do **not** count as significant figures (they only indicate order of magnitude). Example: 0.0486 g has 3 SF = 4.86 × 10⁻².  

- Trailing zeros:: are significant **if** before or after a decimal point.  
Example:  
  - 4200 L = 4.2 × 10³ → 2 SF.  
  - 4200. L = 4.200 × 10³ → 4 SF.  

- Exact numbers (defined quantities):: are error-free and have infinite significant figures.  
Examples:  
  - 1 mL = 1 cm³.  
  - Oxygen = 15.996 g/mol.  
  - 3 eggs = exact count.  


## Rules for Significant Figures in Mathematical Operations  

- Rounding rule: Round up if:: the first non-significant figure is ≥ 5.  
### Addition & Subtraction  

- In addition/subtraction, the number of sig figs in the result is limited by:: the number of **decimal places** in the least precise measurement.  

- Example: 6.8 + 11.954 = 18.754 →:: answer = 18.8 (3 SF).  
### Multiplication & Division  

- In multiplication/division, the number of sig figs in the result is:: the same as the number of sig figs in the least precise measurement.  

- Example: 6.38 × 2.0 = 12.76 →:: answer = 13 (2 SF).  

</br>
- Mass (by difference) = 1832.0 g – 926.2 g =:: 905.8 g.  

- Volume (perfect sphere, r = 3.05 cm) =:: (4/3)πr³ = 28.3726 cm³.  

- Density (not yet rounded) =:: 7.621566 g/cm³.  

- Correct density with SF rules =:: 7.62 g/cm³ (3 SF).  

## Density: a quantifiable physical property  
![[Pasted image 20250928112135.png|175]]
- The formula for density is:: d = mass ÷ volume.  

- Density answers the question:: “How heavy is a given volume of a substance?”  

- The density of a substance depends on: 
?
  1. The mass of its individual particles (atoms, ions, molecules).  
  2. How tightly packed together the particles are in the structure.  

- Density is:: a characteristic, intrinsic, physical property of any pure substance.  

- Why is density considered an intrinsic property?:: Because it does not depend on the amount of substance, only on its identity and structure.  

## Density as an identification tag  
![[Pasted image 20250929093420.png|500]]

- Why is density useful for identifying substances?:: Because density is a **characteristic intrinsic property** — it does not depend on the amount of substance.

- Density of water at 20 °C =:: 0.9982 g/cm³.  

- Density of aluminum (solid) =:: 2.70 g/cm³.  

- Density of iron (solid) =:: 7.87 g/cm³.  

- Density of copper (solid) =:: 8.96 g/cm³.  

- Density of mercury (liquid) =:: 13.6 g/cm³.  

- Density of gold (solid) =:: 19.32 g/cm³.

- A compound is:: a pure substance that requires **chemical means** to be subdivided into simpler substances.  

- Can compounds be separated into elements by physical methods?:: No, only by chemical means.  

- Compounds are composed of:: two or more elements’ atoms or ions in a **fixed ratio**.  

### Representation of compounds  

- A compound’s composition is represented by:
?
  1. **Chemical formula** = atom-to-atom ratio.  
  2. **Percent composition** = % of each element by mass.  

- Example: In 100.0 g of water:  
  - 11.19 g from H atoms (11.19%)  
  - 88.81 g from O atoms (88.81%).  
### Properties of compounds vs parent elements  

- Properties of compounds are:: very different from their parent elements.  

- Example:  
  - Water (H₂O): non-flammable liquid.  
  - Hydrogen (H₂): highly flammable gas.  
  - Oxygen (O₂): combustion-supporting gas.

## Breaking down compounds into elements  
![[Pasted image 20250929094238.png|300]]
- Compounds require:: **chemical means** (not physical methods) to be broken down into elements.  

- Electrolysis is:: the process of passing a high electric current through a liquid to decompose it.  

- Electrolysis of water (H₂O) produces:
?
  2 H₂O(l) → 2 H₂(g) + O₂(g).  

- Electrolysis of molten NaCl produces:
?
  2 NaCl(l) → 2 Na(s) + Cl₂(g).  

- These are examples of:: **redox reactions** (reduction–oxidation).  


## Covalent vs Ionic Compounds  

- **Covalent compounds** are made of:: molecules = atoms bonded together into a discrete unit.  
  - Example: Water (H₂O), Caffeine (C₈H₁₀N₄O₂).  

- **Ionic compounds** are made of:: ions (charged +/– atoms or groups) arranged in ratios that give neutral combinations.  
  - Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl).  
![[Pasted image 20250929095231.png|550]]

## Identifying substance type by building block  


![[Pasted image 20250929095552.png|500]]
?
**Answer:**:: C.  
- Figure A: pure compound (all identical molecules).  
- Figure B: pure element (all identical atoms/molecules).  
- Figure C: mixture of two different elements (two distinct types of diatomic molecules).  
- Figure D: mixture of a compound and an element.  

## Energy: some basic principles  

- Energy can be classified as:: potential or kinetic.  

### Potential energy = energy associated with position  

- Gravitational energy example:: an object held at a height, waterfalls.  
- Chemical energy example:: energy stored in molecules due to bonds between atoms.  
- Electrostatic energy example:: attractions between charged or partially charged particles.  
- Nuclear energy example:: attractions between nuclear particles (released via fission, fusion).  

### Kinetic energy = energy associated with motion  

- Mechanical energy example:: movement of a macroscopic object (e.g., a ball).  
- Thermal energy example:: motion at the particulate level.  
- Electrical energy example:: movement of electrons in a conductor.  
- Acoustic energy example:: compression-type wave motion.  

## Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT)  

![[Pasted image 20250929145556.png|600]]  

- KMT states:: matter consists of particles in constant motion.  

- Relationship between kinetic energy and temperature:: higher temperature → higher particle kinetic energy → faster motion.  

- Between particles, there are:: forces of attraction.  

### Temperature effects  

- At low temperatures:: KE is low → attractive forces dominate → matter usually solid.  

- At higher temperatures:: KE increases → particles overcome attractions → matter changes to liquid or gas.  

## Why density changes with temperature  

- For most substances:: density ↑ as temperature ↓.  

- Why?  
  - At lower T → particles have lower KE.  
  - Attractive forces between particles become more significant.  
  - Particles move closer together.  
  - Volume decreases → density increases.  

- Always specify ==temperature== when discussing density or volume.  

![[Pasted image 20250929150432.png|600]]
## Density of H₂O (special case)  

- At 0 °C, density of ice =:: 0.917 g/mL.  
- At 0 °C, density of liquid water =:: 0.99984 g/mL.  
- At 4 °C, density of water =:: 0.99997 g/mL (maximum density).  
- Why is ice less dense than liquid water?:: In solid state, H₂O molecules are locked in a lattice that keeps them farther apart than in liquid.  

## Phase changes  

- A phase change is:: a physical change (organization of particles changes, composition does not).  
- Melting point of bromine =:: -7.2 °C.  
- Boiling point of bromine =:: +58.8 °C.  
- When particles move closer together:: energy is released as heat.  
- When particles move farther apart:: energy input is required.  

## Physical properties  

- Physical property =:: a characteristic that can be observed without changing composition.  
- Examples:: color, odor, state of matter, melting/boiling point, solubility, conductivity, malleability, ductility, magnetism, viscosity, density.  

## Mixtures vs Pure substances  

- Heterogeneous matter =:: non-uniform in appearance, always a mixture.  
- Homogeneous matter =:: uniform appearance, may still be a mixture.  
- Solution =:: a homogeneous mixture with variable composition.  
- Pure substance =:: fixed composition, cannot be purified further by physical means.  
- Element =:: cannot be subdivided by physical or chemical methods.  
- Compound =:: cannot be subdivided by physical methods; elements in fixed ratios.  

![[Pasted image 20250929153129.png|600]]

## Separating mixtures (physical methods)  

- Filtration separates:: heterogeneous solid–liquid mixtures.  
- Distillation separates:: homogeneous mixtures of volatile liquids (most volatile distills first).  
- Chromatography separates:: mixtures based on movement of components in a mobile phase vs stationary phase.  

- Example: Ink separation by chromatography uses:: paper as stationary phase + water/alcohol as mobile phase.  

## Physical vs Chemical change  

- Physical change =:: change in organization of particles, not identity.  
  Examples: melting butter, boiling water, dissolving sugar.  
- Chemical change =:: change in composition, rearrangement of bonds.  
  Examples: burning butter, rusting iron, reacting Na with water.  

- In chemical changes, atoms are:: rearranged but conserved.  

![[Pasted image 20250929152944.png|550]]

## Chemical properties  

- Chemical property =:: tendency of a substance to undergo chemical change.  
- Examples: combustion, rusting, tarnishing, hardening, violent reaction with water.  

## Clicker Q: sulfur  

- Which statements about sulfur describe chemical change?  
  1) Melting underground sulfur with steam.  
  2) Separation after cooling.  
  3) Burning sulfur in oxygen → SO₂ → acid rain.  
?
Statement 3 only.

## Extra context

- Reproducibility is a **cornerstone of the scientific method** — if others can’t repeat your results, your findings lose credibility.
    
- Detailed reporting avoids **ambiguity** and ensures science builds on previous work.
    
- Being unbiased means **avoiding cherry-picking data** or overstating conclusions.
    
- Giving credit ties into **academic integrity** and plagiarism rules — always cite sources, even in lab reports.
</br>
- A number alone (like “20”) is ambiguous — 20 grams vs 20 liters are completely different.
    
- Units provide the **scale and meaning** of the measurement.
    
- This concept is foundational for **dimensional analysis**, which you’ll use a lot in Chem 205.
</br>
- **Random error →** affects **precision** (scattered results, but average may still be correct).
    
- **Systematic error →** affects **accuracy** (consistent shift from the true value).
    
- Example:
    
    - Random → fluctuations in reading a thermometer.
        
    - Systematic → bathroom scale always off by +2 kg.
</br>
- **Top-loading balance:** wider uncertainty (±0.01 g), but average closer to 2.35 g → _accurate, less precise_.
    
- **Analytical balance:** much tighter spread (±0.0009 g), but shifted lower → _precise, not accurate_.
    
- This is a classic case of **systematic error** (calibration issue).
</br>
- **Exact numbers** never limit the number of SF in calculations. Only **measured values** do.
    
- The clicker question is a good reminder: if the uncertainty is in the ±1 mg digit, you should **round to the last certain digit (tenths of a mg here)** → that’s why the correct answer is **5 SF** not 6.
</br>
- For addition/subtraction → focus on **decimal places** (line up the numbers, lowest precision controls).
    
- For multiplication/division → focus on **total sig figs**.
    
- Goal = final answer must reflect the **uncertainty of the least precise value**.
</br>
- Always **carry extra digits** during intermediate steps, then round once at the end.
    
- For subtraction: 1832.0 – 926.2 → answer must keep **one decimal place** (since both values had 1 decimal).
    
- For final density: sig figs limited by the least precise measured value (3.05 cm → 3 SF).
</br>
- Example: a brick and a block of Styrofoam of the same size have different densities because of particle mass + packing.
    
- Density helps in **identifying unknown substances** (each pure substance has a characteristic density).
    
- Units: g/cm³ (solids, liquids) or g/L (gases).
</br>
- Density values are **unique enough** that comparing a measured density to a reference table can help identify an unknown sample.
    
- For example:
    
    - If you measure ~8.9 g/cm³, it’s likely copper.
        
    - If ~19.3 g/cm³, you’ve got gold.
        
- This is why density is sometimes called an **“identification tag.”**
</br>
- Bromine (Br₂) is used here because it exists in **all three states under different conditions** (solid crystals, liquid bromine, bromine vapor).
    
- Gases are the most mathematically modeled (gas laws, kinetic theory). Liquids are complex because of intermolecular forces.
</br>
- Elements are the **simplest substances** in chemistry — they can’t be broken down further without nuclear reactions.
    
- Their **physical state** (solid, liquid, gas) varies at room temperature:
    
    - Most are solids.
        
    - Only **Hg (mercury)** and **Br₂ (bromine)** are liquids at room temp.
        
    - A few (e.g., O₂, N₂) are gases.
        
- These examples (Hg, S, Cu, Fe, Al) help visualize how the same definition applies across very different appearances.
</br>
- Fixed ratios are governed by the **law of definite proportions** → always the same composition by mass for a given compound.
    
- The dramatic difference in properties (e.g., flammable H₂ + reactive O₂ → stable water) highlights why compounds are new substances, not just mixtures.
</br>
- Physical methods (like filtration, distillation) can separate **mixtures**, but not compounds.
    
- In electrolysis:
    
    - Hydrogen gas forms at the cathode (reduction).
        
    - Oxygen gas forms at the anode (oxidation).
        
- This is a great example of how **laws of conservation of mass and atoms** apply → total atoms of H and O are the same before and after.
</br>
- Covalent → electrons are **shared** between atoms.
    
- Ionic → electrons are **transferred**, forming charged ions that attract.
    
- Covalent compounds exist as discrete molecules, while ionic compounds form large **crystal lattices**.
</br>
- **Mixture** = more than one type of particle (molecule or atom) present.
    
- **Pure substance** = only one type of particle, whether it’s an element or a compound.
    
- In exams, they like to test if you can distinguish between:
    
    - Pure element (atoms or same molecules).
        
    - Pure compound (identical molecules with 2+ elements).
        
    - Mixtures (different species together).
</br>
- **Potential** = stored energy due to position, configuration, or structure.
    
- **Kinetic** = energy of motion, whether visible (ball rolling) or microscopic (atoms vibrating).
    
- Chemistry focuses a lot on **chemical energy + thermal energy**, since chemical reactions involve converting between these.
</br>
- Explains why melting/boiling happen: particles gain enough KE to overcome intermolecular attractions.
    
- Gas laws (Chem 206) are built on KMT: pressure results from particles colliding with container walls.
    
- **Equation link:** KE_avg ∝ T (in Kelvin).
</br>
- Water’s density anomaly explains why **ice floats** (unique among liquids).
    
- Phase changes involve **latent heat** — energy goes into overcoming attractions, not raising temperature.
    
- Physical vs chemical property → often tested by trick questions (e.g., solubility = physical, combustibility = chemical).
    
- Separation methods show up in labs — filtration = heterogeneous, distillation = homogeneous, chromatography = identification/purity.
    
- Accuracy: always describe substances **before and after** an observation.
